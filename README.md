## Abstract：
Flexible systems hold significant potential in various applications like human-machine interface, biomedicine, and soft-robotics1–7. 
However, the risk of interface failure due to modulus mismatch between flexible components and rigid circuits limits the system’s complexity and durability. 
Few studies focus on this issue, and none match the diverse features of flexible systems. 
In this work, we demonstrated a cocoon-mimetic feature-matched interface (CFI) which offers a stable electrical interface in a plug-and-play manner. 
It also matches flexible systems features in stretchability (lower than 0.22 Ω cm-1 during 900% elongation), durability (stable resistance after 6000 times 100% elongation), breathability (gas permeability 614 mm S-1) and skin-mountability (0.18±0.01 N mm-1). 
This interface also protects flexible circuits from mechanical interference and prolongs their durability by reducing crack propagation during repetitive strain circles. 
CFI separates the sensor’s fabrication and electrical interconnection process. We developed a direct spray-on-skin sensor and used CFI to form a hand task recognition system. 
This system, deployable in seconds, has 97.7% accuracy in eight hand task recognition. 
This research offers a promising solution for flexible systems interfacing and packaging challenges and will help this area move forward to real-world applications.
